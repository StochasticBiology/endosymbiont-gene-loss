# endosymbiont-gene-loss

Properties of genes involved in endosymbiont gene loss.

Pipeline taken (and reduced) from https://github.com/StochasticBiology/odna-loss . `symbiont-loss.sh` is a Bash script wrapping the analysis. Some records are downloaded from NCBI, some unzipped from accompanying data. A Python script pulls gene statistics for these records and outputs to a CSV file. An R script then reads and processes this for visualisation.
